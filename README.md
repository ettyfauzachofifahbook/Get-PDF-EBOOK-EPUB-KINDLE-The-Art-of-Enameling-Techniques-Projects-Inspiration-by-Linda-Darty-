The Art of Enameling: Techniques, Projects, Inspiration by Linda Darty Book Review

Title: Get this book if you are starting out
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 19, 2022
Review: I am starting to use enamels, and got this book after I saw it recommended multiple times on specialized forums.

Boy am I glad I did! This book opened up a world of possibilities to me. It contains technical information, but more importantly, so much inspiration and demystifying of techniques + how to make them your own. So much great enamel art is in this book, some classical-looking, but the majority is very contemporary and highly inspired. Honestly this book helps elevate your inspiration and gives you the means to elevate your techniques as well. It‚Äôs the opposite of many other books that focus on technique and showcase well-executed but unsurprising enamel art (no diss to those books, they both have different purposes). For a beginner it‚Äôs amazing to see how artists push the medium.

The section (and examples) about making your own glass chips was a lightbulb moment for me, as well as the section about tube riveting. Also the section about engraving fired enamel and then wet packing the ridges to create enamel inlays. Mind blown. Prong setting is made to look approachable as well.
This books raises the creative stakes!
The step by step examples at the end are thoughtful techniques and shapes and are written in a way that gives you room to make them your own.

Title: Only book need to get started
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 16, 2022
Review: This is a really comprehensive book. It provides great tips, hard won lessons, and enough redundancy is built in to be helpful as you read without being annoying. It also provides some interesting historical notes as well. Linda Darty is a very good teacher, generous with her information and provides some wonderful examples. Anyone just starting out can get a good foot up with this book and with a few educational videos that can be found by other artists for free online you can be enameling in no time. All the tips I've learned from videos I was delighted to see covered by Linda Darty in this book. Don't hesitate to buy this one.

Title: Best enameling book I own, great reference, great photos
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 11, 2018
Review: This is the best enameling book I've ever read. It somehow covers basic to intricate all in one book. You can get this book as a beginner and refer back to it forever.
You also get a bit of a bonus, Linda includes lots of great information on techniques that aren't enameling directly. Foldforming, encaustic (seriously! I thought I was one of ten people actually doing encaustic lol) etching etc. Now she doesn't go in depth, but that would make this heavy detailed book even longer (not that I would complain Haha).
She does go into super detail about enameling, as one would hope. I don't think I expected how detailed though. Extensive information into different types of enameling, torch, kiln, wet, dry, then techniques, painting, pouring, sifting (detailed photos and hints on proper sifting technique!), stencil, Sgraffito (scratching), drilling dry fired and filling with fresh wet or dry. How to fix, make bezels, set into bezels, think about your piece and determine the best way to plan how it will be set.
*takes breath*
Aand..... on it goes. The single most comprehensive book on enameling I own, and I own several.
We love our books, inspiration, reference, reading when we can't be doing... so we will always collect them, however, if you are starting out or have limited budget or are looking to add to your extensive library with a book of substance this is your book. More than worth it's price (don't tell anyone else so the price doesn't go up but this could be priced as a textbook, it's laid out like a class she teaches and it's jam packed with years of experience... worth several times it's price! Shh lol).

This book will be posty note marked on every page. Wealth of information and inspiration newbie to professional. Drool worthy photos. Must have for every artist using enameling in their work. Lots of historical information about enameling so it's a lesson in the evolution of enameling as much as the process.
Photos are showing the amazing things a master can do with enamels but don't be discouraged, she spends tons of time showing basic steps to becoming a master yourself. This is 176 pages cram packed with tips, tricks, suggestions, history and life experience.
I can't say enough good about it... clearly lol.
Get this book, you will not regret it!
